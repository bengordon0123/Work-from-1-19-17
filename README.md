Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and print if it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don't just use three if statements.

number = input("Number: ")

if number > 0:
	print("The number is positive!")
elif number < 0
print("The number is negative!")
      else number == 0
      print("The number is zero!")
